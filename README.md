# Winiskapi
*Work in progress.*

Winiskapi is a personal relationship manager with event planning features, [inspired by Monica](https://github.com/monicahq/monica). Winiskapi will offer a convenient, flexible interface for storing information and memories about your contacts, and will allow you to leverage that data to plan memorable events.

## Planned features
 - Create and update contacts without leaving the dashboard.
 - View all updates and events associated with a contact on their profile page. View a feed of all changes on the dashboard.
 - Receive email reminders for birthdays, anniversaries, and other special events.
 - Pull in specified data fields for attendees on event pages. For instance, include your guests' food and drink preferences when planning a dinner party.
 - Record relationships between contacts. Winiskapi can use this information to suggest additional guests or warn about potential conflicts when planning events.

Winiskapi is built using Flask, Postgres, and React.
